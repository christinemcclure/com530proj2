    <h3>New Home Page</h3>
    <p>Once I put my new site live, I realized that I hated the layout (of course). I had spent so much time 
    thinking about responsive-ness and mobile-first that I hadn't paid enough attention to the design. 
    So here is the <a href="http://dev.christinemcclure.com">new home page</a> I'm envisioning.</p>

    <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
    <p>I've been learning a bit about the Ruby programming language using the Rails framework. It's slow-going because it's such a terse language, but you can see a small example of an application I'm currently developing at <a href="http://electric-ice-8535.heroku.com/">the Heroku site.</a></p>
