PROJECT SUMMARY
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

I set an expansive project scope for my self for two reasons:

1. To force myself to expand my skillset and include as much of the new technologies we've learned as possible. 
2. To create a complete site so that I can promote my photography side business more actively. 

I definitely bit off more than I could chew here, but I feel like I'm starting how to design more responsively and learning how to set a baseline grid will be very useful. I'm having a hard time finding older versions of IE to test in because Windows 7 won't run any versions earlier than IE8 now. I'm concerned that there are a lot of problems hiding on my site that I need to fix. 

I'm somewhat happy with the site, but what I'd really like to do is use the knowledge I've learned from this class and start over from scratch: I'll definitely bemore conservative with the box model layout so that I can get a responsive site more easily.
