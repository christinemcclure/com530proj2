<p>This exhibit was a visual representation of living with illness. 9x9" Silver gelatin prints were mounted between sheets of plexiglass, and digital images (also between plexiglass) printed on transparent film were "floated" above the prints using plastic tubing to keep the two images apart.</p>
<p>The prints showed the external word, while the transparencies showed the internal.</p>
