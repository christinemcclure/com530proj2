          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>I've been fascinated with photography ever since my childhood in the seventies, where I staged a photo shoot using a velour bathrobe as a backdrop, ceramic dog figurines as models, and my trusty little 110 plastic camera.          </p>
          <h4>Exhibitions</h4>
            	<p><strong>Portals</strong> Looptopia, Chicago IL. May 2007 – Looptopia</p>
              <p>This exhibit explored how people experience art. The images were encased in self-lit 6 x 6" boxes, with a large plastic loupe (magnifying glass) mounted to the top. Rather than discretely passing by the images, viewers had to walk directly up to them and peer inside. The images were arranged in groups of three, and let users explore alternate worlds of religion, nature and mythology.</p>
            	<p><strong>Retrospective</strong> Gallery 302, Chicago IL. August 2004</p>
              <p>This exhibit showcased my favorite digital and silver gelatin prints, including the new piece "Persephone's Garden."</p>

      <h2><img src="/img/Xtemp.png" alt="photo of librarian action figure" />Librarianship</h2>
        <p>I'm enjoying the disparity of being both an old hand and a newbie. I wandered around the IT consultant environment for many years as a quality assurance geek, writing code to test code. A work-related epiphany in 2004 (Do this for another 30 years? No way!) sent me to library school. I'm now happily ensconced as a Digital Services Librarian at a private university in Chicago. My goal is to provide a rich online experience for students that doesn’t take a library degree to navigate.</p>
